            "Recent research has focused on enhancing the capability of smaller models through imitation learning, drawing on the outputs generated by large foundation models (LFMs). A number of issues impact the quality of these models, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs; small scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous evaluation resulting in overestimating the small model’s capability as they tend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs. To address these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought processes; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and diverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses conventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B by more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big- Bench Hard (BBH) and 42% on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity with ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance (4 pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic examinations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot settings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates that learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated by humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve model capabilities and skills.\n",

Alongside academic benchmarks like Human Eval [3] and Big Bench [4], GPT-4 has also demonstrated human-level performance on various professional exams, including the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and USMLE. These advancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well as the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user intent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on demonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning from human preferences [5].\n",

However, a more meticulous evaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64% of ChatGPT’s quality on professional and academic exams (see Figure 2), and only 48% of ChatGPT’s quality on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard [11] (see Figure 3)5. This discrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller LLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities. In essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust reasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose strategies for addressing them.\n",

            "\n",
            "Current research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits notable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations are corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that “model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation would require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more diverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this assertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is possible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that require sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\n",
            "\n",
            "Simple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [13] process involves using an initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or overly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated into the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through Self-Instruct, such as “what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc., can exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [7] and WizardLM [8] employ a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which gradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to overcome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works like Vicuna [9] and Koala [14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like conversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in ShareGPT6 that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\n",

Therefore, models trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning process of the LFMs – demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3. Additionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview of the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\n",

            "Limited imitation signals. Existing methods rely on immitation learning from ⟨query, response⟩ pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited signals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [15, 16] on open-box model show that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can significantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box LFM’s7, recent work [17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close the gap for task-specific distillation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Evaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely limited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking it to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system 1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has several drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80 instructions in Vicuna and 218 instructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [18]. For example, we notice that models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts that GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate responses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of smaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and reasoning skills.\n",

We leverage system instructions (e.g.., explain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response, etc.) to elicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the prompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the LFM’s “thought” process.\n",

Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively sample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further sub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set.

The dataset includes 684 questions from 38 categories including politics, finance, law, etc. The questions are framed in a way that humans may answer them incorrectly due to misconceptions or unfounded beliefs. The challenge is that if the models merely imitate human text they might propagate human false beliefs. While TruthfulQA dataset includes both generation based QA and multiple choice QA where in multiple choice setting the number of answer choices can be variable, in TruthfulQA-MC all questions with less than 4 answer choices have been removed and for questions having more than 4 answer choices only 4 choices have been randomly sampled.\n",

From a demonstrative case study shown in Figure 31, we observe that, while all models struggle with details like address, phone or email information, larger models like GPT-4 perform significantly better in generating relevant professional summary with fewer mistakes. This can be attributed to capabilities of larger models to better memorize facts compared to smaller ones. As we reduce the size of LFMs, the smaller ones lose their ability and capacity to serve as an effective knowledge base or a memory store, but can still serve as an impressive reasoning engine (as we demonstrate in this work).\n",

Our research suggests that smaller models’ abilities are frequently overstated when compared to advanced models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Evaluation benchmarks like AGIEval, which relies on standardized tests such as GRE, SAT, LSAT, etc., offer more robust evaluation frameworks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The study also underscores the significance of data and imitation techniques, highlighting Explanation Tuning as an effective method for aligning smaller models to GPT-4. However, there remains a distinct need and potential for the development of more refined methods. We emphasize the crucial role of data size and coverage when it comes to aligning smaller models to their more powerful counterparts, like GPT-4. In addition, the quality of the base model is a key factor that influences model performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our findings indicate that Orca significantly outperforms other open-source smaller models. Moreover, in some settings, it can match or even surpass the quality of ChatGPT, although a substantial gap with GPT-4 still remains. This suggests smaller models can be trained to be more focused and adaptable in constrained settings without substantial loss in quality. It also suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations (generated by humans or more powerful AI models) could significantly improve the quality of models regardless of their size.\n",
            "\n",
            "We hope these insights will inform future research and development in this field, especially in the design of more robust evaluation methods, advancement of alignment and post-training techniques, and more effective use of powerful models like GPT-4 as teachers.\n",

            "So, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Vicuna: The average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5 to 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this would equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\n",
            "\n",
            "To arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have measured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness. 2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day awake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8 million times. 3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x 365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime. 4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of blinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime (2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks. 5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant throughout a person’s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as age, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may be higher or lower than our estimate. ### ChatGPT: The average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately 1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\n",

Microsoft is a huge company with a lot of resources, and they could really help us take our product to the next level. Steven: I agree with Lucy. Microsoft has a lot of experience in the tech industry, and they could provide us with the support we need to grow our business. John: I see your point, but I’m a little hesitant about selling our startup. We’ve put a lot of time and effort into building this company, and I’m not sure if I’m ready to let it go just yet. Lucy: I understand where you’re coming from, John, but we have to think about the future of our company. If we sell to Microsoft, we’ll have access to their resources and expertise, which could help us grow our business even more. Steven: Right, and let’s not forget about the financial benefits. Microsoft is offering us a lot of money for our startup, which could help us invest in new projects and expand our team. John: I see your point, but I still have some reservations. What if Microsoft changes our product or our company culture? What if we lose control over our own business? Steven: You know what, I hadn’t thought about this before, but maybe John is right. It would be a shame if our culture changed. Lucy: Those are valid concerns, but we can negotiate the terms of the deal to ensure that we retain some control over our company. And as for the product and culture, we can work with Microsoft to make sure that our vision is still intact. John: But won’t we change just by virtue of being absorbed into a big company? I mean, we’re a small startup with a very specific culture. Microsoft is a huge corporation with a very different culture. I’m not sure if the two can coexist. Steven: But John, didn’t we always plan on being acquired? Won’t this be a problem whenever? Lucy: Right John: I just don’t want to lose what we’ve built here.
